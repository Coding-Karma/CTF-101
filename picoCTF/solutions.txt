# Remeber to submit all your answers in the format of picoCTF{your_answer}
# All the solutions have been done in debian linux OS

1. Forensics Warmup 1 
Just download the file.
open the terminal and cd to Downloads
Type "unzip flag.zip" to extract the file
Just view the jpg file to capture the flag.


2. Forensics Warmup 2 
The extension PNG is just a facade
Actually it is not a png file.
Just open the file with a browser and there you have the flag


3. General Warmup 1 
Type python in terminal.
Then ommit 0x and type "41".decode("hex")
There you have your flag


4. General Warmup 2
Type python in terminal 
Type "bin(given_number)" to get your flag


5. General Warmup 3
Type python in terminal
Type "h = '3d' (press enter)
	i = int(h, 16) (press enter)
	print i"


6. Resources
Go to the link
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and find for picoCTF string


7. Reversing Warmup 1
Download the file
Change the permission of the file by typing "chmod 777 run" in terminal
Now execute the file using "./run" command.


8. Reversing Warmup 2
Go to python in terminal
Copy the weird base64 string and type "'weird_string'.decode('base64')"
There you have the flag, submit it in the specified format


9. Crypto Warmup 1
It is a simple example of what is called as 'Vignere Cipher'
So find online tool for vignere decoding and follow the instructions to retrive your flag


10. Crypto Warmup 2
It is rot13 encryption challenge.
Again decode using online decoder


11. grep 1
Download the file
Type "cat file | grep pico"
There you have your flag


12. netcat
Copy the url and type "netcat url port_number" 
You got your flag


13. HEEEEEEERE'S Johnny! 
A little tricky challenge for those of who are not familiar with how linux stores user 
information and hashes the passwords 

User info. is sotred at /etc/passwd
and the hashed passowrd for corresponding users is stored at /etc/shadow

Jhony here refers to a free password cracking tool John the Ripper

I am using Kali Linux here, so I have it pre installed. It you dont have it look online how to install it.

Now first donwload both the files
unshadow the files using "unshadow passwd shadow > file.txt"
now this file can be used as input to john the ripper tool
Just type "john file.txt" and you will have the password on the terminal screen


14. strings
Here we will be using the strings command in linux
The strings command returns each string of printable characters in files. 
Its main uses are to determine the contents of and to extract text from binary files (i.e., non-text files).

Go ahead and download the file 
Just type "strings strings | grep pico" 
There you go !!!


15. pipe
pipe is a form of redirection that is used in linux to send the output of one program to another for further processing.

It is done using "|" symbol between two successive commands 

To solve the challenge you are provided to connect to the given url and find the flag through junk outputs.

Which concludes at a simple solution like "nc url port | grep pico"

 
16. Inspect Me
Go to the link. Right click and click on inspect element.

Read the html source code to find 1/3 part of the total flag
Then find the remaining flag parts in js and css files


17. grep 2
Connect to the shell and login with your credentials
next cd to the specified path.

You will encounter the bunch of overwhleming number of files to look through for your flag

Don't worry grep -r (recursive) search flag is here

Just type "grep -r picoCTF path" 

The file containg the picoCTF flag will pop in no time


18. Aca-Shell-A
This one's an interesting one and tricky for those new to linux. As the description suggests you, 
I also recommend on learning linux commands, then its nothing much

Just follow the commands as they are written bellow (along with " and ')

cd secret
ls
rm *
"echo 'Drop it in!' "
cd ..
cd executables
ls
./dontLookHere
whoami 
cp /tmp/TopSecret passwords
cd ..
cd passwords
cat TopSecret

And you are done !!!


19. Client Side is Still Bad
The below mentioned script might be overwhelming but you can do it manually very easily
by inspecting the source code and solve the javascript function "verify()" written in html of the page.

Just read it in reverse order and u fetch your flag.

Direct script goes like this
curl -s "http://2018shell3.picoctf.com:8249/" | head -n 20 | cut -d "'" -f2 | tac | head -n 8 | tr -d "\n"


20. Desrouleaux (Unsolved)


21. Logon
Here I have used a web proxy tool named Burpsuite

Configure the burpsuite with your browser and intercept the request that is sent over when you type anything 
in the username and password field

You will see that the admin flag is set to False in that request just switch it to True and there you go !

You will have the flag given to you just like that.


22. Reading Between the Eyes
Here donwload the image
Use online image decoder to get the flag.


23. Recovering From the Snap (Unsolved)


24. admin panel (Unsolved)


25. assembly-0 (Unsolved)


26. buffer overflow 0
Connect to the given shell with your credentials.

Read the source code to find 
That it takes an input file called flag.txt and then expects a command line argument which it copies to a buffer of 16
using unsafe function strcpy.

Just have a command line argument larger than 16 character while running the vuln file and you are set

I found that it gave the output as picoCTF for number of charcter greater than around 27 chars before that it gave segmentation
fault (core dump) error.
